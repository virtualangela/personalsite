Angela Carr's sequence explores the introspective self and how it exists in relation to the intimacy between her and her partner after undergoing prolonged periods of both isolation and cohabitation brought on by the pandemic. The work aims to emphasize the way in which human beings cling to one another in times of darkness or uncertainty in the universe, while examining moments of existentialism, and playing with parallels of divinity experienced in both religion and human love.
